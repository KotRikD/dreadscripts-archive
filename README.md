Hi! This is an archive of scripts from the coolest script author I know â€“ Dreadrith. Unfortunately, the author of the original scripts has decided to delete all his work due to some kind of mental quirk, which I fundamentally disagree with.

If you, as an open-source developer, decide to delete something that people are using, it's disrespectful to your community. I'm not judging his life in any way, but as a content creator, it does cause me some inconvenience.

To the original creator: if you know your work is being used, think twice before doing something like that.
